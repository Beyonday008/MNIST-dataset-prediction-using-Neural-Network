# MNIST dataset using Keras(Neural Net) and visualition using opencv (Deep Learning)


## General info
Here we are loading mnist dataset of various handwirting and predicting the digit and visualizing it using opencv ie computer vision.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Opencv
	
## Setup
The following Dependencies are required for running:-

```
$ pip install tensorflow
$ pip install keras
$ pip install opencv
$ pip install numpy

```
## CODE

* For Code There is a Jupyter Notebook Download it and run it .

* The results of each cell of jupyter notebook is also clearly mentioned.

* There is Also a Result Folder which contains images of my prediction.
